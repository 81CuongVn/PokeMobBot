## Bot is working, MobBot Redux Version in Development
The latest Version is compatible with PoGo 0.33. Keep in mind that many of the API calls made by us ( and every other open source Bot out there ) are wrong. They will most likely flag you and get you banned.<br>
Thats why we started to work on a new Bot some while ago. MobBot Redux will feature a fully modular architecture, Plugins API and a totally redone API that focuses on emulating the client. More Informations & Updates on this on [our Twitter Page](https://twitter.com/PokeMobBot).
